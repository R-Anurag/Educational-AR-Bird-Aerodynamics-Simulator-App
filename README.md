# 🐦 AR Bird Aerodynamics — Unity + Vuforia

An interactive **Augmented Reality (AR) app** built with **Unity (URP)** and **Vuforia**.  
The app anchors 3D bird models to real-world image targets and allows users to switch between them.  
A custom particle system with a virtual fan model simulates airflow, helping visualize aerodynamic forces like **lift, drag, and resistance** for each bird.

## Features
- Marker-based AR using 2D image targets  
- Multiple 3D bird models with switching support  
- Airflow simulation via particle systems  
- Visualization of aerodynamic forces (lift, drag, resistance)  
- Built on Unity URP for optimized rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2021.x (or newer)  
- Vuforia Engine (installed via Unity Package Manager)  
- AR-capable mobile device (for testing builds)

### Setup
1. Clone this repo:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Open the project in Unity Hub.  
3. Import Vuforia Engine via Window → Package Manager (or import your package).  
4. Add your Vuforia License Key under:  
   Edit → Project Settings → Vuforia Engine → App License Key  
5. Build & Run on an Android/iOS device.
